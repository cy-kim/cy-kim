### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cy (she/her). Iâ€™m a Software Engineer with a background in Architecture and Creative Technology.

I have always been working with technology and solving problems through code, starting from my undergraduate studies in Architecture at Carnegie Mellon where I used Grasshopper to algorithmically generate robot instructions to [fabricate trusses](https://www.cy-kim.com/timber) to my transition into a Web Developer where I created a [P2P video calling site](https://github.com/cy-kim/listen-more-than-you-speak) â€” with a twist where the participantâ€™s video sizes depend on how long they have been talking. I have since worked as a Frontend Engineer at a startup in the usage-based billing space and worked for a non-profit organization to develop an interactive site for one of their campaigns.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning: PostgreSQL and Prisma.
ðŸ”¨ Currently working on: Improving my P2P video calling site to have multiple rooms and deploy it on AWS.
