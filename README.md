### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cy (she/her). Iâ€™m a Software Engineer with a background in Architecture and Creative Technology.

I have always worked with technology and solving problems through code, starting from my undergraduate studies in Architecture at Carnegie Mellon where I used Grasshopper to algorithmically generate robot instructions to [fabricate trusses](https://www.cy-kim.com/timber). Then I transitioned into a Web Developer with my most notable personal project being a [P2P video calling site](https://github.com/cy-kim/listen-more-than-you-speak) with a unique twist: the sizes of the participants' videos depend on how long they have been talking. I have since worked as a Frontend Engineer at a startup in the usage-based billing space and worked for a non-profit organization to develop an interactive site for one of their campaigns.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning: PostgreSQL and Prisma.
<br>
ðŸ”¨ Currently working on: Improving my P2P video calling site (Socket.IO and WebRTC) to have multiple rooms and deploying it on AWS.
